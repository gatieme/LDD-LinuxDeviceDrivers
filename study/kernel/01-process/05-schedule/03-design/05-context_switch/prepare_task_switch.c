/**
 * prepare_task_switch - prepare to switch tasks
 * @rq: the runqueue preparing to switch
 * @prev: the current task that is being switched out
 * @next: the task we are going to switch to.
 *
 * This is called with the rq lock held and interrupts off. It must
 * be paired with a subsequent finish_task_switch after the context
 * switch.
 *
 * prepare_task_switch sets up locking and calls architecture specific
 * hooks.
